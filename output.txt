     >A local druid has posted signs asking for hunters to register their names with him before taking any game. 3 arrows are piercing one of them, and others are torn or ripped. A few stags antlers have been tied to tree trunks, as if in defiance.
     >The city’s most powerful adventurers return from questing in a temple of Tharzidun.
     >While passing through town one day, the party see a queue of people backed up from a door in the wall. There is no signage to suggest what might be beyond the door. Hundreds of people are waiting to get in, and the queue goes right round the corner of the street. When they return this way they see the queue looking just as long. Close observation shows that every time someone goes through the door, which happens every two minutes and thirty seven seconds another person joins the back of the queue. Furthermore, they are the same people, on a repeating cycle. Yet no one comes out of the door and there is no rear entrance. If they try to get closer to the door to see what's inside, the people in the queue accuse them of queue-jumping and get belligerent, forming up as a mob to prevent the PCs skipping the line. If the party back up, they return exactly to their correct places in the queue.

When they arrive at their first destination however, they find that the poison isn't just putrid - it's deadly.
     >Next to a small town there is a cave that leads deep, deep into the hills. What lays at it's very depths is unknown, however, as seemingly every twist and turn people make them end up outside again, leaving through the very entrance they came in through.

There's just one problem: nobody has ever seen anyone deliver supplies to make the baked goods he sells.
     >Screaming is heard deep in the forest, although it doesn't sound anything like person.
     >The characters are sent to a primitive island to retrieve an item/find a treasure/seek an npc. The island is filled with dinosaurs, near-humanoids, and dire animals. As the pc’s explore the island they begin to devolve, as do their animal companions, mounts, familiars, etc.
     >Throughout the town, seemingly happy people have been telling loved ones "wait for me a while" or "I'll be back in a bit," then killing themselves. Days later, the graves of some who have died this way have been found open and empty.
     >After smoke from a forest fire turns the sun and moon blood red, local children start to mark ashy third eyes on their foreheads and will only speak in whispers.
     >In the market square, a beautiful priestess asks help kidnapping the king's son. She says if they do not burn him alive in a sacrificial ritual, a terrible early winter storm will ruin the harvest creating starvation conditions come winter. Don't worry, she can bring the lad back once the sacrifice is complete.
     >The PCs are sent to deal with a raiding ogre that turns out to be a gnome illusionist.
     >While travelling, they hear a call for help from a nearby field of crops. There, a young farmer is being attacked by a Blight. After saving the farmer, she offers the party a visit to a local fairy spring in exchange for helping to find why her crops have gone mad and started biting. This sets up to a fight against a large Blight or evil Treant.
     >Representatives of several evil cults, religions, and social groups are protesting and campaigning for the king to grant them equal status to all the good and neutral gods, religions, and social groups, claiming that Alignment is Not A Choice and since their gods are just as real as Good Gods, they deserve equal representation. The PCs are hired to guard one of their rallies.
     >Miners go in, resources come out, but if you walk into the mine, it deadends about 50ft. down the shaft, and there are no veins to be seen.
     >A glacier has been discovered with an enormous, nightmarish creature inside and the ice is beginning to melt.
     >As a merchant was driving his wagon through town last week, a box fell from it and landed in the middle of the road. The locals have tried moving the obstruction, but though it seems to be a normal wooden box, it can't be opened and can't be moved.
     >A string of killings occurs in the local village. Every morning a body appears in the square horribly mutilated by numerous small blunt objects. Despite attempts to catch the culprit, the town watch reports never seeing the crime happen or having fallen asleep at their post. At the scene of the crime is always a duck with a blood crusted bill.
     >Walking around the grounds outside, the East Wing of the mansion is much larger than it seems on the inside. The West Wing has an extra story on the inside than can be seen from outside.
     >Out in the mountains; people out and about on daily errands -- frozen in place, some mid step; unmoving and unaware.
     >Up in Simon's Pass through the mountains, there is a cave that is said to whisper the names of travelers as they pass. No one who has gone deeper into the cave than the entryway has ever returned.
     >Cultists have been gathering materials and setting up a sacrificial altar. Apprehend them before their evil plot unfolds.
     >There is a singer named Bertram who often performs in the Customs Plaza by day and at the Cat and Goat in the evenings who sings the loveliest duets, taking on both the high-pitch and the low-pitch parts, making both voices harmonize from his golden throat at once. When asked how he manages both the low and the high parts, Bertram insists with a smile that he doesn't sing the low parts, his infernal master does. If you ask to speak to his infernal master, Bertram laughs and lightly says, "What master?".
     >The King has been murdered while at his summer palace from the capital city. He is dead of a knife wound in his own bedchamber. There does not appear to be any forced entry and the guards posted saw and heard nothing. The palace's soul gatehouse reports that no one came or left the palace last night.
     >A host of giants marches towards the city.
     >A ruined tower is in fact a colossal animated object.
     >A mountain village is plagued by unexplicable earthquakes. It's actually the wrath of a Greater Earth Elemental, who had an eye ripped out by a clueless miner who thought it was a normal gem.
     >Members of a coven have infiltrated the city's populace and are working their black magic.
     >A con artist posing as a priest is fleecing peasants.
     >A fountain that spouts water which heals all sickness has erupted from the ground. Those who drink from it become dependent and violent and soon start killing anyone who approaches the font.
     >The party finds a ray gun. It fires twice reliably, and then only ever again if the owner is near death (under 1/4 of total HP). Range: 120 Damage: 2d6 necrotic and 5% chance to disintegrate target. This automatically works on a critical hit. The gun will function 1d20+1 times before burning out. It cannot be repaired. Its owner, a young Illithid hunter, may come looking for it.
     >A group of men burst out of the nearby tavern, fighting bloodily with knives and skillets, chairs and broken tankards. The fighting engulfs the party.
     >The PCs seek an answer/information from a forgotten bard. When they find him, he is a ghost and he will only help them if they give him peace by finishing his final poem/song/movement.
     >Due to a recent famine, many of the townspeople have been eating dog meat just to stay alive. Soon after, many have heard of large packs of dogs ambushing travelers outside town.
     >A wizard with a feud with the party turns the party into dogs. They need to find a way to change back.
     >An eccentric wizard dies and leaves behind his tower. He has no heirs and no will, and the city wants to claim the property and auction the contents of his tower. However, the wizard was a bit of a hoarder, and the contents of the tower are starting to interact with each other. The city guards refused to go near the place after the front garden sprouted tentacles and started attacking.
     >The king has died without an heir. Several distant relatives are claiming the crown. The party is cornered by supporters of one of the claimants, will they support their claim? Immediately following this encounter, the party is cornered by supporters of a rival claimant, what did they promise the first one? Blood, intrigue, and/or chaos ensue.
     >A snowstorm has been raging for months, seemingly centered on a certain mountain.
     >Something happened in the village just east of here. Everybody is dead, and no one quite knows why. The only person who got out alive was the blind beggar.
     >Prisoners are being sold to mindflayers.
     >The only local ruling families to ever keep their hold on the throne had heroic bloodlines. The baron and his wife have the wealth, political skill, and connections, but not a drop of heroic blood. It is a well known rumor that any adventurer who can gather some fame with their exploits will spend time in the lap of luxury as a court concubine. Then again, I did only say the baron's family seeks to add heroic blood, didn't I...
     >The God of Time punishes a town/city/village for not worshiping him, making everything happen out of sequence.
     >After defeating a group of have a very angry dragon (too powerful for the PC's to defeat) swoop in on the PC's and demand that they replace the and send them on missions to raid caravans/villages/ships etc. Have a riot forcing them into uncomfortable moral, political, and legal situations in service of their dragon overlord.
     >There's something weird in the neighborhood, and it don't look good. Ghosts have recently been frightening the residents of the neighborhood where the party has been recuperating after their last grand adventure.
     >A grandmotherly, if slightly senile, NPC asks the players to rid her attic of rats. The rats are in fact a group of thieves trying to open a magical doorway left by the wizard that previously owned the home.
     >Famous Dwarven smith, Gragnar Battlestein, recently did a show-and-tell at his smithy of some of techniques. Mysteriously, only two days later, his hammer went missing. It was probably one of the two hundred attendees, so at least there's a starting point for the investigation!.
     >The characters are shrunk by an evil wizard and have to find a way to reverse the spell.
     >The price of fish is up, now is the time to buy a rod.
     >First post wasn't on topic, so I'm back for more: Of course, not all resurrections are made equal. Sometimes the plant reagents have gone bad, or the wrong ones were picked. Sometimes the person had been dead for too long. And sometimes, like this time for instance, part of the characters soul was invaded by a parasite upon reentry into the physical world. Slowly, she loses the spark of life. She can still move, still talk, and is as strong as ever, but her voice has gone flat and her appetite has disappeared. At first you thought it was some sort of depression, but then last night happened. Out of the blue, her magic stopped working. The high counsel of wizards suggest you kill her again, and capture the soul as it leaves her body. This way, you can separate host from parasite, but of course, this is a dangerous, and risky process. And hasn't been tried for many centuries. Books will need to be dug up from ancient tombs, and long lost reagents found. This'll be a long one, but your characters very soul is at stake. Better act fast before there's nothing left!.
     >As a merchant was driving his wagon through town last week, a box fell from it and landed in the middle of the road. The locals have tried moving the obstruction, but though it seems to be a normal wooden box, it can't be opened and can't be moved.

     >Out of the blue, dark red spirals appear wherever the players are. They seem to be organic in nature, twitching, breathing, sometimes even screaming. Their sudden appearance only seems to be noticed by the players, though. The pillars seem to have a weird effect on townsfolk and other figures around though.

     >The hanging corpse of a local Ranger hangs from a tree, his hands and feet have been removed and cannot be found. A bloody carving in his naked chest may be identified as the feyclan mark of a family of Quicklings. There are skull-dangles throughout the forest and many traps.

There are also some rumors floating around the town: 
     >The town's buildings are slowly growing from their tops, at a rate of about one story per fortnight. No doors lead to the new rooms, but entering through the windows with a ladder will reveal that the completed stories are furnished and show signs of use.
     >A hag has terrorized the fens North of Glynnflldych for as long as anyone can remember, stealing lambs from the farmers and making strange demands from travelers passing along the fen road. The village tolerates her, mostly because the hag keeps the local bullywugs at bay, but a trio of brothers demanding her eviction have rallied a growing number of locals to their side, and they're looking for some muscle.
     >Upon entering the village, one notices the air is still and there is strange dust covering nearly everything, even the people. The villagers claim many of their kind simply vanished and they are unable to leave the village grounds - they reappear on the other side when entering the nearby woods. The adventurers go to the nearby river past the tree-line and find an old dock with a shack and rowboat. Across the river is the exact same shack and boat, imperfections and all. Heading across the river, they find the exact same village mirrored and all the missing people from the first village.
     >The lights come in the fog, always with the fog, like a great wyrm from the mountains, and then the town that sees them is no more. Rumour says the Wyrm is moving closer to the city. (13th Warrior Weeee).
     >A small library, with no librarian. Any book taken disappears after a day. Always seems to have the books one desires.

When pressed, he reveals that he had intended to the slay the dracolich that resides under a hill, deep in the woods, but things got out of hand. He'll gladly share some of the hoard if you'll help him finish the task. His lady wife (a seeress who hates seeing her prophecies fail) will be most disappointed if he returns home empty-handed.
     >After enrolling in a tournament of skill, agility, and strength at the behest of their mysterious sponsor, the party discovers that nearly every challenge has been rigged against them. At first, it's simple, petty things; an arrow without fletching, a set of weighted die. But when a steeplechase across town ends in the tragic deaths of a beloved noblewoman and her lover, all signs point to something more sinister.

Ever since the discovery of the miracle, hundreds of pilgrims make the dangerous journey to Haz Alaf every late spring to witness the miracle.

It is known for its...

It is currently in the midst of a calamity... 
      > A faction is contesting the authority of the recently appointed leadership.
There are also some rumors floating around the town: 
     >Neighboring kingdoms on opposite sides of a mountain are about to go to war. The only way to stop it is to escort the emissary to the other kingdom - through the mountain passage.
     >The party is sent to deliver a package to a private residence, it turns out to be a humiliating task (think pizza delivery). Will the party put up with the insult?.
     >A very liked NPC (usually young) who follows the party has his/her own goals, after following them for a while that person realizes that reaching that goal won't come soon. Have a different band of "adventurers" appear as a rival match for the party, eventually making the protege.
     >At a local haberdashery, a hatter creates works that astonish and amaze even the most sophisticated of hat enthusiasts. No matter what price he sells them for, people fight to be the one to buy them. What seems odd, though, is the faint magical aura on each hat that nobody else seems to see. What caught your attention was that the aura felt a lot like an undead...
     >The Assassin's Guild is planning to kill the mayor.

(This is the material component of a “Secret Chest” (from the spell of the same name) for the ruthless lady-mage Aumurille, who will likely want it back....) (75gp)
     > Lip balm
     > A pair of steel flasks, sealed with wax bearing the symbol of St. Cuthbert. (Holy water, 25gp each)
     > Sunglasses of Charisma. Found on an airship captain, I described them as something you'd see on Elton John. They're big, gaudy, gold and gem encrusted and probably heavy. They gave bonuses to Charisma and Diplomacy. The PC's, who up to this point were all good, immediately put the game on hold to plan a way to steal these and/or kill the owner in the attempt.

     >Tales tell that the king's daughter has the most beautiful golden hair. Tales are right; her hair is actually made of spun gold. Needless to say, she is kept under lock and key in the castle, and every ounce of shed or cut hair is whisked away to the treasury before you can say "exploitation." One evening, a member of the party receives a letter by raven, pleading for rescue. There is no signature, but inside the folded paper are three strands of the finest gold.
     >The Necromancer's first-risen despairs at the endless pain of his existence. His master gave him life - or something close to it - but all he feels is an absence that cries out to be filled. The length of his new 'life' has given him strength and cunning, as well as a place beside the Necromancer's throne of skulls, but he hungers for something more. Perhaps with his master's death he may find an end - one way or another.
     >There are five shards of a legendary dagger hidden across the land and they are well hidden. If the party gathers them all they get a legendary prize.
     >Crafting guilds are not cooperating and intermediates can make a lot of money.
     >A town is being slowly deconstructed, brick-by-brick, with each piece of material floating slowly north to a large, orderly pile of similar material. Each day a brick or two is taken, and the townsfolk have become experts at shoring up and repairing the damage.
